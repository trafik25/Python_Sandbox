#A Boolean value is either True or False
#Boolean values are often used to keep track of certain conditions, such as 
# whether a game is running or whether a user can edit certain content on a website:

car = 'subaru'
print("Is car == 'subaru'? I predict True.")
print(car == 'subaru')

print("\nIs car == 'audi'? I predict False.")
print(car == 'bmw')
